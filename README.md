Abstract— Social experiments on crowd-controlled gaming have been done on video games which are devoid of any physical obstructions/limitations. The best example is Twitch Plays Pokémon where players from all over the world played Pokémon Red by inputting commands (A, B, up, down, left, right, start, select) on chat while watching the live stream. This paper shows a detailed analysis of varying number of players (1, 2, 4, …) on physical wheeled robot TwiPi (Twitch Raspberry Pi Bot) and its comparison with video game (Pokémon Red). The infinite monkey theorem states that a monkey hitting keys at random on a typewriter keyboard for an infinite amount of time will almost surely type any given text, such as the complete works of William Shakespeare. This situation is quite like the theorem. The only and the most important difference is that instead of random hitting of keys, multiple intelligent entities are trying to solve a problem with a specific goal.
